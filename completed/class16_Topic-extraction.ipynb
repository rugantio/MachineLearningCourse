    "We need to transform our text data into feature vectors, numerical representations which are suitable for performing statistical analysis. The most common way to do this is to apply a bag-of-words approach where the frequency of an occurrence of a word becomes a feature for our classifier.\n",

    "## Mathematical details\n",
    "\n",
    "tf–idf is the product of two statistics, term frequency and inverse document\n",
    "frequency. Various ways for determining the exact values of both statistics\n",
    "exist. In the case of the '''term frequency''' tf(''t'',''d''), the simplest\n",
    "choice is to use the ''raw frequency'' of a term in a document, i.e. the\n",
    "number of times that term ''t'' occurs in document ''d''. If we denote the raw\n",
    "frequency of ''t'' by f(''t'',''d''), then the simple tf scheme is\n",

    "\n",
    "  * boolean_data_type \"frequencies\": tf(''t'',''d'') = 1 if ''t'' occurs in ''d'' and 0 otherwise; \n",
    "  * logarithmically scaled frequency: tf(''t'',''d'') = log (f(''t'',''d'') + 1); \n",
    "  * augmented frequency, to prevent a bias towards longer documents, e.g. raw frequency divided by the maximum raw frequency of any term in the document: :$\\mathrm{tf}(t,d) = 0.5 + \\frac{0.5 \\times \\mathrm{f}(t, d)}{\\max\\{\\mathrm{f}(w, d):w \\in d\\}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The '''inverse document frequency''' is a measure of whether the term is\n",
    "common or rare across all documents. It is obtained by dividing the total\n",
    "number of documents by the number of documents containing the\n",
    "term, and then taking the logarithm of that quotient.\n",

    "  * $|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|$ : number of documents where the term $t$ appears (i.e., $\\mathrm{tf}(t,d) eq 0$). If the term is not in the corpus, this will lead to a division-by-zero. It is therefore common to adjust the formula to $1 + |\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|$. \n",
